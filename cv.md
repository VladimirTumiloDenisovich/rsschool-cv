## About Me:

   I worked as a multimedia engineer for many years. He started in the theater working with sound and video equipment. Later, he independently designed sound equipment in theaters and stadiums, and then programmed sound projects to make it all work and bring pleasure to visitors.\
   My profession was closely associated with fellow programmers who made all this equipment work through the API. It looked interesting and I decided to retrain as a programmer.

   In my free time, I make music and play tabletop role-playing games.

## Code Example:

   An example of my solution on the site codewars, the complexity of the task is 6kyu

**DESCRIPTION:**

   Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.

**Examples:**

`"the-stealth-warrior"` gets converted to `"theStealthWarrior"`

`"The_Stealth_Warrior"` gets converted to `"TheStealthWarrior"`

`"The_Stealth-Warrior"` gets converted to `"TheStealthWarrior"`

**Me solution:**
```
function toCamelCase(str){
    let result = ''
    for (i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        if (str[i] === ' ') {
            result+= str[i + 1].toUpperCase()
          i++
        } else if (str[i] === '-') {
            result+= str[i + 1].toUpperCase()
          i++
        } else if (str[i] === '_') {
            result+= str[i + 1].toUpperCase()
          i++
        } else {
            result+= str[i]
        }
    }
    return result
}
```
